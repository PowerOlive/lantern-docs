<h2>Is Lantern safe for me to use?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-lantern-safe-for-me-to-use" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lantern IS a tool to provide access.</li>
<li>Lantern IS NOT an anonymity tool.</li>
<li>Lantern IS NOT designed to prevent monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Only add Lantern friends that you really trust</strong>. If you are in a censored region, itʼs extremely
important you only choose Lantern friends you really trust. Your internet traffic will run through the computers of the people you are connected with on Lantern. If you add people you donʼt trust, you risk adding a user that could be monitoring you.</p>
<p><strong>Lantern sends your traffic through peers up to four degrees away from you</strong>. To build a more connected and scalable network your traffic can be sent through friends of friends of friends of friends. We do this because most
users don’t directly know anyone across the censorship divide. Every additional link in the chain exposes
you to a less and less trusted user.</p>
<p><strong>Use Tor if you want anonimity.</strong> If you don&#8217;t want sites you visit to have access to your IP address, physical location, or you can&#8217;t risk network monitors determining what sites you visit, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is great software. We communicate with the Tor team frequently. Again, Lantern’s purpose is access. Tor’s purpose is anonymity.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t post sensitive content to sites hosted in regions where the government will pursue you.</strong> With any tool, including both Lantern and Tor, you should never post sensitive content to a website that is hosted in a region where the government will pursue you for posting such content. This is especially important if you live there. A global network observer
like the government can identify you as the person who uploaded the
content and will be able to geolocate you. <em>This is probably the most dangerous thing you could do,
so make particularly sure you&#8217;re posting to sites hosted outside of the
country if you think that content could be controversial in some way.</em></p>

<div class="section" id="how-does-lantern-work-if-i-can-t-reach-any-users-giving-access">
<h2>How does Lantern work if I can&#8217;t reach any users giving access?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-lantern-work-if-i-can-t-reach-any-users-giving-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To help get the Lantern network started we have set up [[Lantern Cloud
Servers]]. These serve as fallbacks to proxy traffic when no other users
are available to give access. Our hope is that as the Lantern network
grows, there will be enough users giving access that we will need fewer
and fewer fallback servers.</p>
<p>Our other plan is to give people an option to sponsor additional Lantern
Cloud Servers dedicated for them and their friends. We also hope to
partner with companies that have spare computing capacity and want to
help internet freedom by donating servers to the Lantern network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-lantern-compare-to-other-tools">
<h2>How does Lantern compare to other tools?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-lantern-compare-to-other-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lanternʼs goal is to give users access while being fast, secure, and
easy to use. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is one of the most
popular tools in this space with a primary focus on anonymity. For those
who do not care about being completely anonymous, Lantern provides an
alternative with typically faster access. Compared to other tools aimed
at access (GoAgent, Freegate, Ultrasurf, Psiphon, Autoproxy) Lanternʼs
strength is the ease with which it can be installed and used, as well as
its trusted peer-to-peer network architecture designed to scale in the
presence of censors. <strong>The use of real-world trust relationships in
Lantern also makes it extremely resilient to blocking attempts.</strong></p>
<p>By default, Lantern runs as a system proxy, which means that browsers on
your computer will use it automatically, without your having to change
any of their settings. Some other tools only work with one specific
browser, or require complex configuration.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect in Lanternʼs design is its peer-to-peer
architecture, which allows data to come from many computers at once,
rather than a single server. Peer-to-peer architectures also allow
networks to scale to millions of users at a fraction of the cost of more
centralized architectures.</p>
<p>Recently, the Lantern team has contributed to
<a class="reference external" href="https://uproxy.org">uProxy</a>, a new effort sponsored by Google Ideas.
While there are similarities between the two, there are also some
important differences. For one, Lantern is an independent app that stays
running in the background, while uProxy is a browser extension, and
currently requires asking a single friend to proxy for you on a
per-session basis, so with Lantern you can have many peers give you
access at the same time as opposed to just one. Another difference is
Lantern allows friends of friends up to 4 degrees away to connect to one
another, whereas uProxy only allows direct friends. Finally, to be
faster and more blocking resistant, by default Lantern proxies access
only to a specific set of sites you configure (see below), whereas
uProxy reroutes traffic to all sites through your uProxy peer while you
have it enabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-does-lantern-not-proxy-every-site-by-default">
<h2>Why does Lantern not proxy every site by default?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-lantern-not-proxy-every-site-by-default" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default, Lantern only provides access to a list of known blocked
sites. We do this for a couple of reasons. First, it is always faster to
go to a site directly rather than through a proxy regardless of how fast
or efficient that proxy is. So sites that arenʼt blocked will be fastest
if they are reached directly instead of through Lantern.</p>
<p>The second reason is that not proxying access to sites that are known to
be unblocked frees up Lantern network resources. Because the Lantern
network as a whole doesn&#8217;t have to carry the burden of providing access
to unblocked sites, it can instead use those resources to provide you
with better access to blocked sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-the-trust-network-work-what-happens-when-i-add-someone-as-a-lantern-friend">
<h2>How does the trust network work? What happens when I add someone as a Lantern friend?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-the-trust-network-work-what-happens-when-i-add-someone-as-a-lantern-friend" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lantern is built on a trust network. This network connects people who
trust one another to share internet connections. When you and another
user are Lantern friends with one another, you can proxy traffic for one
another using Lantern. However, if Lantern proxied only through direct
friends, users would often have no proxies available whenever none of
their direct friends were online giving access.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, Lantern users getting access can discover a subset of
the users giving access up to 4 degrees away from them in the trust
network. So for instance, if you use Lantern to get access, your
brother’s partner’s mother’s friend could end up proxying your Lantern
traffic. If this person is a censor, she could block or analyze your
traffic. On the other hand, if you use Lantern to read or post something
private or sensitive, it will look as though this traffic is coming from
her computer. Because of this, everyone running Lantern should only
friend people they trust, and <strong>only use Lantern to proxy traffic that
is not private or sensitive</strong>.</p>
<p>By only adding people you trust, you protect not only yourself, but also
your friends, their friends, their friendsʼ friends, and so on. And by
allowing users to discover a subset of users farther away from them in
the trust network, Lantern increases available proxies while maintaining
blocking resistance.</p>
<p>In any scenario, however, <strong>you have to explicitly approve each user who
will proxy access for you</strong>. You are always in control. Lantern will
never send your traffic through any peer, regardless of how far away
they are in the trust network, without your explicit approval.</p>

<p>Lantern is still in private beta. You can request an invitation and
updates

<h2>I live in an uncensored region and don&#8217;t know anyone in a censored region. Can I still help?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-live-in-an-uncensored-region-and-don-t-know-anyone-in-a-censored-region-can-i-still-help" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Definitely! People in censored regions can still learn about you through
your friends. So while you donʼt know anyone directly living in censored
regions, your friends might, and the odds are even better that their
friends might (and so on). If you keep Lantern running and adding the
people you trust, eventually youʼll be connected with users who need
access. <strong>Thatʼs why itʼs really important to invite your friends to
Lantern</strong>. It maximizes the likelihood that your social network will
reach into censored regions so you can help.</p>

<div class="section" id="ok-i-ve-installed-lantern-now-what">
<h2>OK, I&#8217;ve installed Lantern. Now what?<a class="headerlink" href="#ok-i-ve-installed-lantern-now-what" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For users in uncensored regions, there are two basic things you can do
once youʼve installed Lantern:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Run Lantern as much as possible.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add more users you trust as Lantern friends.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you run Lantern, you create a new access point users in
censored regions can use to access the open Internet. Remember, though,
that only people in your Lantern network will be able to connect to you.
Thatʼs why the second step is critical. The larger your Lantern network,
the higher the odds youʼll provide access to users who need it. <strong>So
please invite as many trusted contacts as you can!</strong></p>

<h2>Will Lantern make my computer vulnerable to hackers?<a class="headerlink" href="#will-lantern-make-my-computer-vulnerable-to-hackers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lantern takes a number of precautions to make sure users are safe.
First, Lantern does not allow anyone it connects you to to read the
contents of your computer. It simply allows you to share Internet
connections. The data passing between you is encrypted so that no
intermediaries (e.g. your government or Internet service provider or
theirs) can read it. Lantern also requires mutual authentication for all
connections, which means that Lantern will only allow users to connect
to you that it can verify are in your Lantern network, and not just
anyone.</p>
