Getting Involved
=================

As with any open source project, Lantern will only be truly successfully
if *you* help out. Right now we're in a 'beta' state, with tons to do
before we spread it to the world. Most of the tasks we need help with
do not require programming knowledge. Of course, developers are more than
welcome, but this page is for everyone else who wants to contribute.

Use and Spread Lantern
----------------------

You can request an invite from getlantern.org using your Gmail address.
If you have an uncensored internet connection, you can make a difference
simply by keeping Lantern running. Every additional user sharing their
connection improves the Lantern network and makes it harder for censors to block.

Whether or not you have an uncensored internet connection, you can also
help by inviting people you trust to join the Lantern network. Lantern
relies on a large network of users who trust each other to share
internet connections. The more trusted connections in the network,
the better Lantern will work. If you are an early user, please spread
Lantern among your trusted friends to help the network grow.

Report Problems
---------------

One of the most valuable
things you can do is report to us if Lantern is *not* working for you. The
ideal way to do this is on the `users forum <https://groups.google.com/group/lantern-users-en>`__. If you
don't feel comfortable with your name in public feel free to use a fake
account/name. You can also use the 'contact' form from Lantern itself to send a message privately to the core developers.

The most important thing to let us know is if you are in a censored
country and are unable to connect at all, but feel free to report more
minor errors and also to make suggestions about ways that Lantern could
work better for you. 

What to Include in a Bug Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In your report, be sure to include:

* the operating system
* the version of Lantern you are running 
* where you are
* Lantern log files. See :ref:`sending-lantern-logs`.
* if you are in *give* or *get* mode. All users in censored countries are automatically in *get* mode.

The image shows 1.0.0-beta2 at the bottom of the Lantern window. This is where you can find your version number.

Translate Lantern
------------------

If you are a fluent speaker of another language and would like to help
translate Lantern's web site, documentation, or the application itself,
we would welcome your participation. See :ref:`translating-lantern`.

Promote Lantern
---------------

We welcome people who are interested in helping spread the word
about Lantern. Our software will only work if many people in uncensored
countries run it.

If you have experience with promoting great stuff in social media campaigns, magazine articles, blog
posts, videos, kickstarter, etc., then get in touch. No idea is too big or too small. For
right now just introduce yourself on the `users forum <https://groups.google.com/group/lantern-users-en>`_. If we get
enough people interested in promoting Lantern, we will start a dedicated forum.

Help with documentation
------------------------

Creating and testing documentation is a great way to get familiar with Lantern and help Lantern users and developers,

If you see an area on this wiki that needs more work and you would like to contribute, please do.

You neede to be added to the
Documentation Team to edit. Let us know you are interested on the `forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en>`__.

Click the **New Page** or **Edit Page** buttons near the top of any wiki page to create or edit a page.

Develop
--------

If you are a developer and are interested in helping build Lantern, see
`Contributing Code <../developer/Contributing.html>`_.

Sponsor
--------

Besides running Lantern on your own computer to share your internet connection, you can also pledge a one-time or monthly donation
to sponsor a Lantern cloud proxy. Lantern cloud proxies provide an additional
high-capacity internet connection to the network 24 hours a day, even
while your computer is off or disconnected.

Alternatively, if there is some feature or bug fix you'd like to see in
the next version of Lantern, you can sponsor its development.

Please contact the Lantern developers about either of these options if
you would like to inquire further.

You can also make a 1-click micro-donation using `Flattr <http://flattr.com/>`_ or `GitTip <https://www.gittip.com/>`_.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lantern. A vibrant and
active community is vital to our existence.
