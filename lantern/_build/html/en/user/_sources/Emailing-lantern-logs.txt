Emailing Lantern Logs
=====================

Occasionally, the core Lantern developers will request that you send them your logs to diagnose a problem.

The logs are located in the following directories:

* Windows Vista/7/8 - ``C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Lantern\logs``
* Windows XP - ``C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Lantern\Logs``
* OSX - ``~/Library/Logs/Lantern``
* Ubuntu - ``~/.lantern/logs``

There may be multiple files in the `logs` directory, but `java.log` is the most important one.

#. Compress the `logs` directory into a zip file.
#. Send the zip file to contact [at] getlantern.org.
	.. note:: If you are very security focused and want a pgp email address to send it to let us know and we can provide one.
