Upgrading to a New Version of Lantern
======================================

When we release a new version, we will send out an email with a link to download the new installer. 
Right now, sending out this email is a manual process.

If you don't receive the email, you can use the link in your original invitation to download the latest version.

We also recently added update notifications to the app itself, so you should be notified there when there are updates.
