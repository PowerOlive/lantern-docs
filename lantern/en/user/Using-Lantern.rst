Using Lantern
=============

After you've finished :DOC:`Setup` you're ready to start using Lantern.

Users **Getting Access**
------------------------

If you are in a censored region and have installed Lantern, simply open your favorite browser and navigate to any blocked site. 
Any browser should work, as Lantern configures itself to handle any connection from your computer.

While your browsing is connecting Lantern reports on the activity. 
On the map there will be a line between your computer and the computers of your friends. 
If your friends aren't available you may see that you are connected to one of the Lantern fallback servers. 
See :ref:`lantern-cloud-servers`.

You can see your bandwidth going up and down in the top-right corner of Lantern. 
This will change as you browse.

If you can't access a web site, you may have to add it to your Proxy Site List.
See :ref:`config-proxied-sites`.

If you are still unable to get access, you can try to invite more friends in uncensored countries who can share their connection with you. 
You could also sponsor a cloud server to help the lantern network. 
See :ref:`lantern-cloud-servers`.

We also have a `forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en>`_ where you can get help.

Users **Giving Access**
-----------------------

Users who are giving access often will not have immediate connections.
If you want to make sure that Lantern is working you can try out **Get Access** mode.

You can explore the map of the Lantern network. 
The bottom of the screen shows the global statistics for everyone on the network - how many users are online now, have ever been online, and the total bandwidth transferred. 
If you mouse over a country it will show you similar statistics for that country. 
You can also mouse over your own user and the users you're connecting to, as dots on the map.

Adding Friends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building your Lantern network by adding friends is the main task for users Giving Access from open countries. 
Adding others in uncensored countries is key for expanding the network. 
And any friend in a censored country that you add to your roster will instantly benefit from your connection and those of your other friends.

And it is critical for users Getting Access to invite more trusted users, to improve the network. 
Adding friends in uncensored countries is directly beneficial for better connections. 
But helping other friends within your country also helps build the Lantern network and connect you to more Lantern proxies.

   :alt: friends

This brings up the 'Lantern Friends' screen. 
You can enter the email address of any friend who has a google account. 
Any gmail address will definitely work. 
If you aren't sure you can just try to add them, as many people have other email addresses set up to work with Google.
Adding them will send an invitation to join Lantern, with a link to the download. 
Once they sign on at the same time as you are on their status in your friends window will change.

The image below shows friends successfully transferring from a user in 'give' mode.

   :alt: friends transferring

Note that there will not always be connection lines between friends.
This happens when the rough location can not be established. 
You will always be able to see if transferring is happening by looking in the upper right corner, or watching the friends list.

Removing people from your friend list will make it so they can not access your connection to the internet and vice versa.

We encourage you to leave Lantern running, so that it can be helping others even if you are not using it right then.
