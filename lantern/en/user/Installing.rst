Supported Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Currently, installation on Linux is only available on Ubuntu.
We greatly appreciate any `contributions <../../developer/html/contributing.html>`_ for other Linux distributions or help with improvements to make better use of package managers. You can also `build from source <https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/blob/master/README.md#wiki-setting-up-a-development-environment>`_.

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^ 
The invitation to Lantern has a link to an installation script that: 

* Downloads a `.deb` file. 
* Creates the uninstall script in the `/opt/lantern-net-installer` directory.
* Creates a user preferences directory.
* Does *not* auto-launch a Lantern service.

#. Click **Ubuntu 12.04+** in the invitation email.
	A browser window opens and dialog appears asking you to open or save the installer.

Supported Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lantern supports OS/X version 10.6 and higher,
64-bit only. 

.. note:: During installation, Lantern checks if you have Java installed. If not, it will download the Java Runtime Environment from the web.

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^

#. Click the **Mac OS X 10.6+** link in the invitation email.

#. Double-click the downloaded **.dmg** file, then double-click on the **Lantern Installer** icon.
	The Lantern Fetcher window appears and starts downloading the most recent installation files.

	.. Important:: As of beta2 the installer will *not* work if you are not running as an admin user. If you are not the admin user, nothing will happen when you click the installer icon. We are `working <https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/819>`_ on getting it to prompt for the admin password instead of not responding.

#. In the password dialog that appears, enter your administrator user name and password. This allows Lantern to install and make changes to your proxy settings so that your internet connection can be shared.

Uninstalling
