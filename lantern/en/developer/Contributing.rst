Contributing Code
=================

Our goal is to make Lantern a truly collaborative open source project with contributors
from many organizations and countries.

How We Work
-----------

If you aren't familiar with open source development processes we highly
recommend reading `Producing Open Source Software <http://producingoss.com/>`__. It's 
available for free but don't hesitate to buy the book (it's written by a friend of Lantern). 
We try to follow the best practices details in this book, so it's a good way to get familiar
with how we work.

Getting Started
---------------

The first step is to check out our
`CONTRIBUTING <https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__
file for relevant information. We follow standard
github model of contributors submitting pull requests and then having
core authors review.

Communicating
--------------
The majority of our communication happens in
`tickets <https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues>`__. You can 
`watch <https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories>`_ the project 
in GitHub and get notifications when an issue is updated.

We also have a `developer forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-devel>`__ on Google Groups that 
we use to communicate. Please don't hesitate to introduce yourself on the forum. We can
find tasks you might be interested in.

You can also sign up to help us triage issues on `CodeTriage <http://www.codetriage.com/getlantern/lantern>`_.

Making Decisions
----------------

Lantern decisions are made by all core developers. Anyone
who contributes sufficiently to development can become a core developer
and help decide the future of Lantern.
