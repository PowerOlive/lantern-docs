    "SAFE_TO_USE_QUESTION": "使用 Lantern 是安全的嗎？",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1": "Lantern takes great pains to ensure that users are safe, but there are cases we cannot protect against, so users need to be aware of how they can use Lantern safely. For users in censored regions itʼs extremely important that you only choose Lantern friends who you really trust. Your Internet traffic will run through those peers. If you add people who you donʼt trust, you run the risk of adding a user who could be monitoring you. So <b>only add Lantern friends that you really trust</b>. Beyond that, <b>Lantern will also send your traffic through peers up to four degrees away from you</b>, that is, friends of friends of friends of friends. We do this to build a more connected, scalable network, as users often don’t directly know anyone on the other side of the censorship divide. However, every additional link in the chain exposes you to a less and less trusted user (i.e. you trust your friends’ friends less than you trust your friends). Always keep in mind that <b>Lantern is a tool to provide access, it is not designed to prevent monitoring</b>.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_2": "<b>Lantern 不是讓您匿名的工具。</b>如果您需要避免您瀏覽的網站得知您的 IP 位置或您本人的實際位置 (雖然可能有點意外，但是他們通常會知道這些資訊)，或是您無法冒會被網路監控器發現您在上什麼網站的風險，我們推薦您使用 <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tor</a>。Tor 是一套相當優異的軟體，我們也經常與 Tor 團隊交流。我們重申：Lantern 的目的是「連線」，而 Tor 的目的是「匿名」。",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_3": "關於安全的最後一點：在一些地區，政府會追查在他們管轄內的網站上的內容張貼者。無論您是使用任何工具，包括 Lantern 或 Tor，您都不應該在那些網站上張貼敏感資訊，特別如果您就住在那些地區的話。這是因為您可能會被全域網路觀察機制（例如政府）辨認出您就是張貼內容的使用者，並且可能會被查到您本人的所在地。",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_QUESTION": "Lantern 會蒐集我的甚麼資訊？",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_ANSWER_1": "This is explained in Lantern's <a href='https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Privacy' target='_blank'>Privacy Policy</a>.",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_ANSWER_2": "The <a href='https://docs.google.com/a/getlantern.org/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ap6nn0WEcFTRdHUtTm9GcFpsNFpoOGFXQlBfODN4TkE&single=true&gid=0&output=html' target='_blank'>Lantern Information Disclosure Matrix</a> explains exactly what is tracked and for what purpose",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_QUESTION": "如果我得不到任何用戶的授權， Lantern 會如何運作？",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_1": "To help get the Lantern network started we have set up <a href=\"https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Lantern-Cloud-Servers\" target=\"_blank\">Lantern Cloud Servers</a>. These serve as fallbacks to proxy traffic when no other users are available to give access. Our hope is that as the Lantern network grows, there will be enough users giving access that we will need fewer and fewer fallback servers.",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_2": "Our other plan is to give people an option to sponsor additional Lantern Cloud Servers dedicated for them and their friends. We also hope to partner with companies that have spare computing capacity and want to help internet freedom by donating servers to the Lantern network.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_QUESTION": "How does Lantern compare to other tools?",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_1": "Lanternʼs goal is to give users access while being fast, secure, and easy to use. <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tor</a> is another tool which is sometimes used for censorship circumvention, but Torʼs purpose is anonymity; circumvention is just a possible side effect. Because of this, Tor can be relatively slow to surf the web. For cases when anonymity is not necessary, Lantern provides an alternative with faster access. Compared to other tools aimed at access (GoAgent, Freegate, Ultrasurf, Psiphon, Autoproxy) Lanternʼs strength is the ease with which it can be installed and used, as well as its trusted peer-to-peer network architecture designed to scale in the presence of censors.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_2": "By default, Lantern runs as a system proxy, which means that browsers on your computer will use it automatically, without your having to change any of their settings. Some other tools only work with one specific browser, or require complex configuration.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_3": "Another unique aspect in Lanternʼs design is its peer-to-peer architecture, which allows data to come from many computers at once, rather than a single server. Peer-to-peer architectures also allow networks to scale to millions of users at a fraction of the cost of more centralized architectures.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_4": "Recently, the Lantern team has contributed to <a href=\"https://uproxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">uProxy</a>, a new effort sponsored by Google Ideas. While there are similarities between the two, there are also some important differences. For one, Lantern is an independent app that stays running in the background, while uProxy is a browser extension, and currently requires asking a single friend to proxy for you on a per-session basis, so with Lantern you can have many peers give you access at the same time as opposed to just one. Another difference is Lantern allows friends of friends up to 4 degrees away to connect to one another, whereas uProxy only allows direct friends. Finally, to be faster and more blocking resistant, by default Lantern proxies access only to a specific set of sites you configure (see below), whereas uProxy reroutes traffic to all sites through your uProxy peer while you have it enabled.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_QUESTION": "Why does Lantern not proxy every site by default?",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_1": "Lantern uses a proxied sites list for a couple reasons. The primary reason is efficiency. It is always faster to go to a site directly rather than through a proxy, even when you can use many proxies simultaneously. So sites that arenʼt blocked will be fastest if they are reached directly instead of through Lantern.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_2": "The second reason is that, to a censor watching your activity, your traffic will look more like it would if you werenʼt running a circumvention tool. So instead of seeing you making encrypted connections to only one or a handful of computers outside the country (i.e. the Lantern users giving you access), a censor will see you also connecting to all the sites not on your list directly, just as when you arenʼt running Lantern. So proxying only blocked sites helps that traffic blend in with all your other traffic.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_QUESTION": "How does the trust network work? What happens when I add someone as a Lantern friend?",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_1": "Lantern 建基於一個互信的網路之上。這個網路將彼此信任、且願意彼此分享網路連線的人們連結在一起。如果您和另外一位使用者互為 Lantern 好友，你們就可以透過 Lantern 當彼此的代理跳板，經由對方的網路連線來連上網際網路。只是，如果 Lantern 只能讓您透過好友往外連線，使用者可能會常常遇到沒有好友在線上、所以無法透過他們的代理跳板往外連線的窘境。",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_2": "為了減緩這個問題，Lantern 設立了一套機制。如果您在 Lantern 被加入好友並被分享網路，您同時也能發現離信任網路以外、最遠達 4 度人際關係的網路分享者。這意思是，如果您透過 Lantern 來翻牆，最後有可能是您「哥哥的伴侶的母親的朋友」來當您的網路代理跳板。如果很不幸他剛好是網路審查者，他就可以封鎖或是分析您的網路活動。另一方面來說，如果您使用 Lantern 來閱讀或分享一些隱私、敏感的資訊，這些資訊都會通過他的電腦往外發送、或是下載回來。因此，使用 Lantern 的人應該只加他們真的信任的人來當好友，而且<b>只使用 Lantern 來傳收沒有那麼隱私或敏感的資訊</b>。",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_3": "只加您信任的人當好友，不僅能保護您自己，也能保護您的好友、他們的好友、他們好友的好友⋯⋯等。而允許使用者發現離他們信任網路比較遠的跳板管道，Lantern 增加了可以使用的網路跳板，也能夠持續與網路封鎖對抗。",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_QUESTION": "我要如何下載 Lantern ?",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is no longer accepting requests for invitations. In order to protect Lantern against infiltration by censors, all invitations are now made by friends to friends.  If you know and trust someone who is already using Lantern, please contact them to request an invitation.",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_QUESTION": "I live in an uncensored region and donʼt know anyone in a censored region. Can I still help?",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_ANSWER_1": "Definitely! People in censored regions can still learn about you through your friends. So while you donʼt know anyone directly living in censored regions, your friends might, and the odds are even better that their friends might (and so on). If you keep Lantern running and adding the people you trust, eventually youʼll be connected with users who need access. <b>Thatʼs why itʼs really important to invite your friends to Lantern.</b> It maximizes the likelihood that your social network will reach into censored regions so you can help.",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_QUESTION": "好，我裝好 Lantern 了。然後呢？",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "For users in uncensored regions, there are two basic things you can do once youʼve installed Lantern:",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_2": "<strong>&mdash; 盡可能的運行 Lantern 。</strong>",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_3": "<strong>&mdash; 增加您可信任的朋友為 Lantern 友。</strong>",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_4": "Whenever you run Lantern, you create a new access point users in censored regions can use to access the open Internet. Remember, though, that only people in your Lantern network will be able to connect to you. Thatʼs why the second step is critical. The larger your Lantern network, the higher the odds youʼll provide access to users who need it. <b>So please invite as many trusted contacts as you can!</b>",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_QUESTION": "Will Lantern make my computer vulnerable to hackers?",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_ANSWER_1": "Lantern takes a number of precautions to make sure users are safe. First, Lantern does not allow anyone it connects you to to read the contents of your computer. It simply allows you to share Internet connections. The data passing between you is encrypted so that no intermediaries (e.g. your government or Internet service provider or theirs) can read it. Lantern also requires mutual authentication for all connections, which means that Lantern will only allow users to connect to you that it can verify are in your Lantern network, and not just anyone.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_QUESTION": "Lantern 是免費的嗎？我需不需要花費額外的東西？",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_1": "Lantern 是免費的、也是自由的：您可以在<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/getlantern/lantern/master/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\">授權合約</a>的範圍下自由的使用、修改及再散佈 Lantern。",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_2": "If your Internet connection is limited, then giving access through Lantern will count against your limit. We recommend using Lantern with unlimited Internet connections.",
