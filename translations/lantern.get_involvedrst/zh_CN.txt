.. _getting-involved:

加入我们
=================

与很多开源项目一样，Lantern 只有在“您”的帮助下
才会真正成功。现在我们正处于“测试”阶段，在向全世界
发布之前我们还有很多事情需要做。其中，我们需要协助的大部分事项
不需要任何有关编程的知识。如果有开发者想要加入，
那当然是好事，但这个页面是给除此之外的其他人一个机会来帮助
Lantern 做得更好。

Lantern 现在处于内测阶段，但我们接受成为“代表”的申请
表单 <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11LiZoCMptcc_lj4b01It9n64gngaDPU53_ge3mhiaIM/viewform>`__
——也就是乐于参与的早期测试者。如果
您对以下一项或多项内容感兴趣，请在您的表单中
提及这一点。我们对住在受限或非受限国家
且有可信联系人的用户特别感兴趣。但您真正需要做的
是愿意投身于完成以下内容。

使用和传播 Lantern
----------------------

如果您有一个不受限的网络连接，您可以通过
让 Lantern 一直运行来做出改变。每一个新增的分享其
连接的用户能使 Lantern 网络更好地工作，也使审查者
更难封锁。

无论您有没有一个不受限的网络连接，您也可以通过
邀请您信任的人加入 Lantern 网络来协助我们。Lantern
依赖一个相互信任并分享网络连接的
庞大网络运行着，所以如果网络中可信的连接更多，
Lantern 也就能更好地工作。所以如果您是一个老用户，请
Lantern among your trusted friends to help the network grow.

Report Problems
---------------

At the current 'beta' stage of development one of the most valuable
things you can do is report to us if it is *not* working for you. The
ideal way to do this is on the `users
forum <https://groups.google.com/group/lantern-users-en>`__. If you
don't feel comfortable with your name in public feel free to use dummy
account / name. You can also use the 'contact' form from Lantern itself
to send a message privately to the core developers.

   :alt: contact


The most important thing to let us know is if you are in a censored
country and are unable to connect at all. But feel free to report more
minor errors, and also to make suggestions about ways that Lantern could
work better for you. Try to give as much detail as possible. See this
`how to report bugs
effectively <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/-sgtatham/bugs.html>`__
for general guidelines. For Lantern be sure to include your operating
system, where you are, and if you are in 'give' or 'get' mode (all users
in censored countries are automatically in 'get'), and what version of
Lantern you're running.

The above is 1.0.0-beta2, you should see some number there.

You also may be asked to email your logs for the developers to diagnose.
See :ref:`sending-lantern-logs`.

Translate Lantern
------------------

If you are a fluent speaker of another language and would like to help
translate Lantern's web site, documentation, or the application itself,
we would welcome your participation. See :ref:`translating-lantern`.

Promote Lantern
---------------

We also welcome people who are interested in helping spread the word
about Lantern. We are mostly software developers, but unlike most
developers our software will only work if lots of people in uncensored
countries run it. So we welcome ideas and actions to get more and more
people to run Lantern. Social media campaigns, magazine articles, blog
posts, videos, kickstarter, etc. - if you've got experience promoting
great stuff then get in touch. And no idea is too big or too small. For
right now just introduce yourself on the `users
forum <https://groups.google.com/group/lantern-users-en>`_. If we get
enough people there we will start a dedicated forum.

Help with documentation
------------------------

This collaboratively-maintained wiki documentation is a work in
progress. If you see an area that needs more work and you would like to
pitch in, we welcome your help. Right now you needed to be added to the
Documentation Team to edit, just let us know of your interest on the
`forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en>`__.
Then to edit just use the "New Page" or "Edit Page" buttons near the top
of any wiki page.

Develop
--------

If you are a developer and are interested in helping build Lantern, see
`Contributing Code <../../developer/html/Contributing.html>`_.

赞助商
--------

Besides running Lantern on your own computer to share an uncensored
internet connection, you can also pledge a one-time or monthly donation
to sponsor a Lantern cloud proxy, which provides an additional
high-capacity internet connection to the network 24 hours a day, even
while your computer is off or disconnected.

Alternatively, if there is some feature or bugfix you'd like to see in
the next version of Lantern, you can sponsor its development.

Please contact the Lantern developers about either of these options if
you would like to inquire further.

You can also just make a 1-click microdonation to the cause in general
using Flattr or GitTip:

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lantern. A vibrant and
active community is vital to our existence.
