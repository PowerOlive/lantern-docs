1
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:10,0
There was a time when a cry for help was
 only heard as far as your voice could travel.

2
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:22,0
Now things are different.

3
00:00:23,0 --> 00:00:25,0
Now someone can be heard in a matter of seconds

4
00:00:28,0 --> 00:00:30,0
all the way across the world.

5
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:34,0
The internet has become a voice for the voiceless

6
00:00:34,0 --> 00:00:36,0
A way to shine awareness on hidden corruption

7
00:00:37,0 --> 00:00:39,0
and it's changing the world.

8
00:00:39,0 --> 00:00:41,0
[crowd chanting]
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

9
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:45,0
Except that freedom isn't available to everyone.

10
00:00:46,0 --> 00:00:50,0
Over a quarter of the world's population lives with government-imposed censorship

11
00:00:50,0 --> 00:00:52,0
and that number is growing.

12
00:00:53,0 --> 00:00:55,0
Politically sensitive sites like Facebook,

13
00:00:55,0 --> 00:00:57,0
YouTube, Twitter, and Google,

14
00:00:58,0 --> 00:01:01,0
the exact sites that are bringing light to corruption and injustice,

15
00:01:02,0 --> 00:01:04,0
are blocked.

16
00:01:06,0 --> 00:01:08,0
ஆனால் நீங்கள் உதவ முடியும்

17
00:01:08,0 --> 00:01:10,0
by using Lantern.

18
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:13,0
Lantern is a safe and secure free software

19
00:01:13,0 --> 00:01:18,0
that gives people internet access in places where access is denied.

20
00:01:18,0 --> 00:01:21,0
It's software that circumvents government censorship.

21
00:01:21,0 --> 00:01:23,0
When you install Lantern on your computer

22
00:01:23,0 --> 00:01:25,0
you provide a new escape route

23
00:01:25,0 --> 00:01:28,0
for getting information in and out of censored countries.

24
00:01:29,0 --> 00:01:31,0
You are giving people a way out

25
00:01:31,0 --> 00:01:33,0
தொடர்பாடலுக்கான ஒரு வழி

26
00:01:34,0 --> 00:01:36,0
All of us are connected

27
00:01:36,0 --> 00:01:38,0
now more than ever.

28
00:01:38,0 --> 00:01:40,0
With a few simple steps, you have the power

29
00:01:40,0 --> 00:01:42,0
to provide equal access to the internet

30
00:01:42,0 --> 00:01:44,0
and help change the world.

31
00:01:45,0 --> 00:01:46,0
Will you?

32
00:01:46,0 --> 00:01:47,0
Join the movement.

33
00:01:47,0 --> 00:01:49,0
Join Lantern.
