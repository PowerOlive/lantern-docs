HTTP
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Used to transfer content such as web pages
	over the internet. Content is sent unencrypted, so any
	`intermediary <#wiki-intermediary>`__ could potentially read it in
	transit. HTTP is therefore not secure. `HTTPS <#wiki-https>`__ is the
	secure counterpart of HTTP.

HTTPS
	A secure version of `HTTP <#wiki-http>`__. Content is sent encrypted to
	prevent an `intermediary <#wiki-intermediary>`__ from being able to read
	it in transit.

Install4g 
	Install4g is a program we use to make the Lantern install experience smoother across all platforms.
	
Intermediary
	An entity on a computer network in between the requester of some content
	and the server which hosts it, e.g. a `proxy <#wiki-proxy>`__ or an
	`internet service provider <#wiki-isp>`__.

ISP
	Internet service provider, an organization which provides internet
	access. Traffic leaving a computer's local network (in a home, office,
	internet cafe, etc.) goes here before either being forwarded to its
	destination, or blocked in the case that the ISP employs censorship.
	Traffic bound for your computer likewise must pass through your ISP
	before it can reach you.

Peer
	Another user you're connected to on a computer network.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
	Describes a network architecture where each computer in the network can
	act as client and server, as opposed to just one or a few servers
	providing service to many clients. Peer-to-peer networks are
	decentralized and therefore more difficult to shut down.

Proxy
	An `intermediary <#wiki-intermediary>`__ which forwards traffic between
	a user requesting content and the server that hosts it, often because
	the user cannot reach the server directly due to censorship.

System Proxy
	A program which proxies traffic for all programs on a computer which
	access the network.
